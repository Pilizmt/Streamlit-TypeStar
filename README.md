# Project to predict the type of star
### Using Streamlit to create an application interface 

This repository contains a web application developed with Streamlit to interact with a previously trained machine learning model.

## Description

The web application provides an easy-to-use interface for making predictions using a pre-trained RandomForest model. Simply enter the required data and get instant predictions.

This is an amazing project that deploys a service in [Render].

## Instructions for Use

1. **Virtual environment installation:** 
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv my_virtual_environment`.
   - Activate the virtual environment: `. my_virtual_environment/bin/activate` (or use the corresponding command for your operating system).

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the application:** **Run the application with Streamlit
   - Run the application with Streamlit: `streamlit run my_app.py`.

4. **Access the Application:**
   - Once the application is running, open your browser and access the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

5. **Interact with the Application:** ** Enter the required data in the application interface.
   - Enter the required data in the interface and follow the instructions to obtain predictions.

## Project Structure

- src:** Contains the source code of the application.
- models:** Stores the trained machine learning model.
- data:** Contains data needed for the application.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have the correct libraries and versions installed in your virtual environment. You can find these specifications in the `requirements.txt` file.


Enjoy the interactive machine learning application!
